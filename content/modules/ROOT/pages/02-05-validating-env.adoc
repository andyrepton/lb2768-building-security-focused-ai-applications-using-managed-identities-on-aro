Now that you are connected to your workbench, let's make sure that all the expected services are responding properly in the cluster.

When you open your workbench you will see your "Launcher" tab:

. At the bottom of the page under "Other", click on "Terminal":

+
.. Run the following command to download a `.env` file that will be used by the Jupiter Notebooks to configure access to the Azure AI services
+

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, bash, subs="attributes+"]
cd
wget {azure_ai_info_url}
cat .env

. The `.env` file that is downloaded will look something like the following (but configured for your enviornment).  Note there are no credentials in it.  That is because the AWS Python SDK will use IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA) to authenticate your pods which are running under a trusted `ServiceAccount`, We'll finish up this trust relationship shortly.

TOFIX: Below should match AWS, don't have a working setup right now
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, bash, subs="attributes+"]
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://my-ai-service.cognitiveservices.azure.com/
OPENAI_API_VERSION=2024-12-01-preview
AZURE_DEPLOYMENT=gpt-4
AZURE_EMBEDDING=text-embeddings
AZURE_AI_SEARCH_SERVICE_NAME="my-ai-search"
AZURE_AI_SEARCH_INDEX_NAME="my-ai-index"


. When configuring your IRSA roles, you need to attach the correct policy for the workload to use. Attach appropriate policy permissions and assign the trust relationship to match the service account and namespace that will be used by your `pods`.
+

**Do not run the following commands** they have already been run for you, and are shown here to show you the IRSA setup.

[.console-input]
[source, bash, subs="attributes+"]
TOFIX: Missing policy ARN at the moment. To be added later
# rosa create iamserviceaccount --cluster ${cluster_id} --namespace ${user} --name workbench --policy

. After a moment you'll get a message that says **"Server unavailable or unreachable
Your server at /notebook/{user}/my-workbench/ is not running. Would you like to restart it?"**, This is because the Jupyter notebook is restarting so that it can use the new AWS Role that we just linked to the service account.  Wait a minute or so and then refresh your browser window.

. In the left hand navigation menu, navigate to the folder called: `parasol-insurance/lab-materials/02`

. Open the notebook called `02-05-validating.ipynb`

. If you have never executed Cells in a Jupyter Notebook before, here is what you need to do:

.. Click on the **Restart kernel and Run all Cells** link:

.. Click **Restart** :

. Running these cells will confirm that all the lab-required services are responding.

The output should look as follows:
TOFIX: Below output should match aws. Don't have a working setup right now

This is a summarized visualization of how the environment is laid out (in some workshops a local PostgreSQL database will be used instead of Azure PostgreSQL):
